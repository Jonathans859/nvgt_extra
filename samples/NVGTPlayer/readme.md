# NVGT Player by BrailleScreen
A simple example sound player for [NVGT](https://nvgt.gg).

## Why?
I wanted a simple sound player that would allow me to listen to a web stream and adjust the volume. More can be added later, but I thought this example might be useful to somebody wishing to load web URLs etc.

## Keys:
* Up / down: Adjust volume.
* V: Report current volume.
* Space: Play / Stop (note that when you play the audio again after pausing it, the stream will reconnect rather than retain its connected state).
* Escape: Exit the program.
